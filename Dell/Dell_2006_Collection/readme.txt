Collection owner - Dell

The suggested stencil directory for Visio 2003, and 2007 is My Documents\My Shapes\Dell

All stencils work best on pages of scale 1:2 to 1:30 - Template pages with the proper 
settings are available for download on the VisioCafe.  Do not use the Visio "Blank page"
which uses a scale of 1:1 (no scale), it has been found to cause a lot of problems.


VisioCafe provides a place for the public to download free Visio stencils from the technology 
industry. If you would like to host your Visio stencils here for free, please contact us at

This set of stencils is developed by VSD Grafx Inc.  If your company would like to have
