Thank you for using VisioCafe.com

The suggested stencil directory for Visio 2003 and 2007, is  My Documents\My Shapes\VSDfx

All stencils work best on pages of scale 1:2 to 1:30. Do not use scale of 1:1 like Visio's "Blank page" (no scale). 


VisioCafe provides a place for the public to download free Visio stencils from the technology industry.  
Our goal is to host the Visio collections of as many vendors as possible and to be the 'go to' site for 
all Visio stencils, including those that are  Microsoft developed (VNE), Vendor self developed, and even 
individually developed.

If your company would like to host your Visio stencils here for free, please contact us at  
info@visiocafe.com.  

If your company would like to have Visio stencils developed, 
please contact  info@vsdfx.com.
